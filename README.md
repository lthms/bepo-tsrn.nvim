# bepo-tsrn.nvim

Opinionated mappings for the bepo layout in Lua, initially forked from
[bepo.nvim](https://github.com/cljoly/bepo.nvim) to remap `hjkl` to `tsrn`
instead of `ctsr`. No configuration is required (or even possible). The mapping
are enabled automatically once the plugin is installed.

This plugin is released under the terms of the Apache License version 2.0, as
is the original project.
